  about: `A dedicated and meticulous Computer Engineering student with a unique international perspective, currently pursuing a Double Degree between CentraleSupélec (France) and UFRGS (Brazil). With hands-on experience in microcontrollers, electronics, and web development, I combine technical expertise with a passion for team coordination and project leadership.

My journey spans from developing portable testing stations at Braskem's industrial facilities to creating web solutions at IDE Jr. I'm deeply driven to expand my knowledge in AI, Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Microelectronics while aspiring to roles that blend technical mastery with strategic management.`,
